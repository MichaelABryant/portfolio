- Performed an exploratory data analysis on a dataset consisting of 2.9 million accident records
- Cleaned data by imputation and by finding missing data through a Python library and API
- Feature engineered by creating dummy variables for cateogrical and string data

# [Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/Heart-Disease-Prediction)
- Created seven machine learning models to make a classification prediction of heart disease using 303 patient records and 12 features
- Performed an exploratory data analysis and feature engineered a categorical risk factors variable based on high cholesterol, high blood pressure, high fasting blood sugar, and age/sex
- Hyperparameter tuned the models and, with a five-fold cross validation, obtained an accuracy of 85.5% and AUC score of 0.941
