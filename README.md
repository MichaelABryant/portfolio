# [Project 1: COVID-19 EDA (SQL/Tableau)](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/COVID19-EDA)
- Performed an exploratory data analysis on a dataset consisting of 106,357 records and 59 variables
- Created two dashboards with eight visualizations of cases, deaths, vaccinations, hospitalizations, and testing for the World and the US
- Queries and visualizations can be used for creating a website or an app, and reports can be automated to give daily summaries of the status of COVID-19 to users and clients

# [Project 2: Vehicle Sales Price Prediction (Python/HTML)](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/vehicle-price-pred)
- Created 12 machine learning models to make a regression prediction of vehicle sales price using 301 vehicle sales records and seven features
- Performed an exploratory data analysis and feature engineered dummy variables for categorical data
- Hyperparameter tuned the models and, with a five-fold cross-validation, obtained an MAE score of $502.69 and R-squared score of 0.9703
- Deployed the best model with a front end as a [web app](https://predict-vehicle-price.herokuapp.com/) which can be used suggest a sales price to the user

# [Project 3: Heart Disease Prediction (Python/HTML)](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/heart-disease-pred)
- Created seven machine learning models to make a classification prediction of heart disease using 303 patient records and 12 features
- Performed an exploratory data analysis and feature engineered a categorical risk factors variable based on high cholesterol, high blood pressure, high fasting blood sugar, and age for increased risk for each sex
- Hyperparameter tuned the models and, with a five-fold cross-validation, obtained an accuracy of 85.5% and AUC score of 0.941
- Example application: predictive model can be used by medical doctors to give patients the probability of having heart disease

# [Project 4: Credit Card Users Cluster Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/Credit-Card-Users-Cluster-Analysis)
- Performed an exploratory data analysis on a dataset consisting of 8950 credit card user records and 18 variables
- Determined a majority of the explained variance, using principal component analysis, was due to users using their credit cards for cash advances or purchases
- Clustered users into four groups based on credit card usage determined by principal component analysis
- Example application: Clusters can be used by credit card companies to target users with specific credit card offers based on previous usage

# [Project 5: US Vehicle Accident Severity Prediction (Python)](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/US-Vehicle-Accident-Severity-Prediction)
- Performed an exploratory data analysis on a 1 GB dataset consisting of 2.9 million accident records and 47 variables
- Cleaned data by imputation and by finding missing data through a Python library and API, and engineered features from categorical and string data
- Prepared data can be used to make models for predictioning accident severity based on date, time, and weather for emergency response services

# [Project 6: Bird Species Prediction (Python)](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/Bird-Species-Prediction)
- Created a convolution neural network to classify photos of birds based on species using 39364 photos and 275 species
- Selected pre-trained model for transfer learning based on initial performance
- Hyperparameter tuned the selected model and modified model architecture to increase accuracy to 95.2%
- Example application: predictive model can be used for a phone app to analyze a users photos of birds and output predictions of the species
